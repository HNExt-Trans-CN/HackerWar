In a desperate attempt to stop the constant Cyber-Attacks

  <!-- You can reference songs from the original game here, or your own .ogg files by path.
  To reference original songs, use their name in the files! You don't need the path, just the filename. This works for any songs in these folders:
  Content/Music
  Content/DLC/Music
  
  To Play your own songs, use the path to that song in your extension.
  For example, try changing the song name below to "Music/Chemical_Burns.ogg" - it'll start with that instead for new saves! -->

  <WorkshopDescription>随着世界的发展，计算机现在正在变得越来越快。

但是不久，一些有心之人便利用这些技术来作恶。
于是，政府为了整顿这一现象，举办了一场比赛，名为...

Hacker Wars

面向于所有黑客，专业人士、黑客主义者甚至是脚本小子都将会参与进来。
这只是一个简单的淘汰游戏，只不过每个黑客都会参与进来争夺自己的一席之地...
在两台或多台计算机直接进行黑客与黑客之间的战斗。最先攻克并完全控制对手的计算机来获胜！

(啊，这不是多人游戏。虽然我可能有一天会以此创作一个多人游戏如果你们希望的话。)

特点:
- 无版税乐曲
- 完整的故事线
- 不需要迷宫DLC (虽然我的确喜欢迷宫DLC，但是我更希望所有人都能玩到这个扩展，其中便包括没有购买迷宫DLC的玩家。)</WorkshopDescription>

  <!-- Path to the preview image used on the steam workshop for your extension.
  This must be within your mod folder, be 16x9 aspect ratio and less than 1MB in size. 
  I recommend the highest resolution you can provide that fits that criteria, 
  though steam will likely use a version less than 512x512 in size, and will auto resize it for you.
  
  This can be different to the provided Logo.png if you want, as this will not be transparently backed on steam.
  Supported formats are .png, .jpg and .gif

  <!-- This is the workshop publish ID. The first time your extension is published to Steam, this will be automatically populated with the ID that steam assigns it.
  When this happens, make sure that you keep that version of the file and store the ID somewhere - without it, you wont be able to push out updates to your extension,
  and if it's removed, publishing to the workshop will submit it as a new entry, and you'll lose all of your subscribers. Be careful!
  Do not manually modify this unless you already know your Publish ID from a previous submission. A new ID will only be generated if this says "NONE"-->
